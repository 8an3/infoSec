## General info
just a collection of tools sorted nicely into submodules. Each module is the original author unless that person dropped the project.
Keeps it up nice and easy to update once and a while -->

## if you have trouble with the submodules

if you fuck up a module you need to go to --->
### infoSec/.git/modules/offensive 
change the config of each module to represent the place and/or proper source for fetch updated code, dont mess with other commands ive seen online dont work as well
dont forget to change the .modules as well... dont know if that file actualy makes a difference though
